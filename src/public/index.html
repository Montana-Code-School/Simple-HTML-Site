        <p class="intro" style="font-size:35px" align:"center">On June 17, 2003 I became a mother for the first time.
        From the first time I laid eyes on my little bundle, I knew I was in love. For almost 14 years
        I have made sacrifices to stay home and raise my children.  Some days I question my decision.
        But then my day changes and I couldnt imagine anything different.  They make me laugh.  They make me cry.
        They make me love life!

    <p class= "definition" style="font-size:35px" align="center"> In my spare time I take care of our little farm, milking the goat, feeding baby goats, gathering eggs from our chickens, and tending to our fruit and vegetable garden.
      I love to spin yarn from the wool I harvest from my two sheep.  When I have some quiet time I also like to quilt.  I am a third degree black belt in Tae Kwon Do and I teach martial arts in my non profit
      Christian-based martial arts school in Stevensville.  I love to sing. Music has always been a big part of my life and I sing in church often. I also play the roll of school teacher to my two boys.
      I have been homeschooling them since my oldest son, Jonathan entered Kindergarden, 10 years ago.  4-H is a big part of our lives as well.  I am the Organizational leader in our 4-H club and am the
      head chairman to the Ravalli County Small Animal Committee.   Summer is my favorite time of year and I spend most of my time outside whenever possible.
      I love being out in the country, enjoying the quiet, and relaxing under the big, blue Montana sky.</p>
