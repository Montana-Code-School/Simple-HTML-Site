## Standards

### File Structure

You will always want to keep all of your files organized properly. I would recommend you follow this structure while we work on basic projects. You can feel free to name the files and the project root as whatever you would like, but keep this structure:

```
My-Project-Folder (folder)

  img (folder)
    myImage.jpg

  css (folder)
    style.css

  js (folder)
    main.js

  index.html

```

"My-Project-Folder" is considered **the root project folder**, which is a term you will see often (I.E Navigate to your project root).

### Spaces vs Dashes

Along with this, I would like to see you all use dashes in folder and filenames, in place of
spaces. Spaces don't work as well when you are navigating using the command line. [You can find a great discussion about this over at Jeff Atwood's blog.](https://blog.codinghorror.com/of-spaces-underscores-and-dashes/)
