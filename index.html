<p class="DarkCanyon-text" style="font-size:24px;">On June 17, 2003 I became a mother for the first time.
From the first time I laid eyes on my little bundle, I knew I was in love. For almost 14 years
I have made sacrifices to stay home and raise my children.  Some days I question my decision.
But then my day changes and I couldnt imagine anything different.  They make me laugh.  They make me cry.
They make me love life!

  <b>Jonathan is my first born.  He is very outgoing and loves to be around people.  He loves to talk (A LOT).  Jonathan is very smart and can do anything that he puts his mind to.
He likes to push his limits and he likes to make people laugh. He has a good, kind heart. Jonathan is a black belt in Tae Kwon Do.  He is also always in a hurry to grow up and is very
 mature for his age. Jonathan loves the outdoors, to fish, hunt, swim, play sports, jog, ride bikes, build things from almost nothing and he loves to do experiments with anything he can find.
He is really good with technology, loves to sing and loves to check out cute girls.  </b>

online.  Matthew enjoys being outside as long as there aren't any bees around.  He loves to fish, swim, ride bikes, play tennis, go for walks and help his dad with tree trimming jobs.  Matthew loves to spend family time
together, playing board games or card games.  </b>

   <b>Rebekah , my little firecracker, reminds me a lot of Jonathan.  She is VERY busy and into EVERYTHING.  She loves to give hugs and kisses.  Rebekah is very curious about everything in her little world.  She can be shy
when she first meets someone but given time will warm up to anyone.  She loves to laugh and is yet another of my children that gets enjoyment out of making others laugh. Rebekah knows
exactly what she likes and wants and what she doesn't like or want - and she isn't afraid to let you know.
 She is my little Ham! </b>

 <p class= "DarkCanyon-text" style={font-size:24px;} background-color: rgb(200, 200, 200);> In my spare time I take care of our little farm, milking the goat, feeding baby goats, gathering eggs from our chickens, and tending to our fruit and vegetable garden.
  I love to spin yarn from the wool I harvest from my two sheep.  When I have some quiet time I also like to quilt.  I am a third degree black belt in Tae Kwon Do and I teach martial arts in my non profit
  Christian-based martial arts school in Stevensville.  I love to sing. Music has always been a big part of my life and I sing in church often. I also play the roll of school teacher to my two boys.
  I have been homeschooling them since my oldest son, Jonathan entered Kindergarden, 10 years ago.  4-H is a big part of our lives as well.  I am the Organizational leader in our 4-H club and am the
  head chairman to the Ravalli County Small Animal Committee.   Summer is my favorite time of year and I spend most of my time outside whenever possible.
  I love being out in the country, enjoying the quiet, and relaxing under the big, blue Montana sky.</p>
