      <h2>A Little About Me</h2>
      <p>I grew up in Missoula, left for a number of years, but now have moved back to town.
      I decided to do the Montana Code Camp because higher education, the sector in which I had been working,
      is increasingly being transformed by new web technologies and the use of other kinds of software.
      I wanted to learn more about it so that I might find new ways of applying it in teaching and research.</p>

      <p>Having made the decision to move back to Missoula, I also knew I needed to be more flexible in looking
     for jobs outside of education. I heard that Missoula's tech scene is growing, so given my interests, I
     thought it would be good to develop some technical proficiency.</p>
